**Code Cleanup TODO**
- [ ] Split large files into partial classes (best done manually in Visual Studio):
  - frmMain.vb (2,081 lines) - suggested splits:
    - frmMain.Resolution.vb: WindowsScaling, GetScaling, CmbResolution_*, ReZoom, FindClosestResolution
    - frmMain.EqLock.vb: DoEqLock, PnlEqLock_* handlers, ChkEqLock_*
    - frmMain.Attach.vb: Attach, Detach, setActive
    - frmMain.Overview.vb: AddAButtons, UpdateButtonLayout, UpdateButtonLayout2, GetNextPerfectSquare
    - frmMain.Utilities.vb: UntrapMouse, Cycle, CloseErrorDialog*, RestartSelf, UnelevateSelf
  - ContextMenus.vb (2,917 lines) -> ContextMenus.vb, ContextMenus.QuickLaunch.vb, ContextMenus.Helpers.vb
  - AstoniaProcess.vb (1,709 lines) -> AstoniaProcess.vb, AstoniaProcess.Window.vb, AstoniaProcess.Registry.vb
- [x] Add debug logging to empty catch blocks (completed)
- [x] Update hardcoded color values to use constants (completed)
- [x] Convert public fields to properties (completed)
- [x] Add onError handler to FileSystemWatchers (completed)

**Feature TODO (from Discord)**
- [ ] Investigate SDL_HINT_VIDEO_EGL_ALLOW_TRANSPARENCY for SDL offscreen rendering
- [x] Add warning icon when client isn't running in DPI Override + manual/auto setting (implemented)
- [ ] BigHealthBars on selected legacy clients (emulate SDL)
- [ ] Low-level mouse hook for smoother cursor tracking (tested - needs different approach, async worker causes position lag/jumping)
- [x] Add confirmation dialog on pasting folders
- [x] Handle QL dropdown overflow for large folders (implemented - shows first 50 items, then "<x more...>" that loads 50 more on click)
- [x] Determine drive type of QL folders and set maxdegree appropriately
- [x] Add installer wizard for sdl2-compat (implemented - Settings > Misc tab)
- [x] Keep QL open after paste and update to reflect changes (implemented - cancels close from OperationStatusWindow, refreshes after paste completes)
- [x] Rename dialog: select to last dot only (exclude folders/lnk/url)
- [x] Show confirmation on renaming extension
- [x] Investigate drag and drop to sort QL items (implemented)

**Known Issues/Bugs**
- QuickLaunch may fail to close when clicking outside of QL after clicking an item with ctrl held.
- Having 2 instances of ScalA on differently scaled monitors attached to same alt is wonky.
  Having 2 instances of ScalA attached to same alt partially overlap leads to undesired results.
-# Please use white-/blacklisting when using multiple profiles.
- Overview button layout sometimes messes up when sorting lists are huge and/or closing a lot of Alts at once.
- ScalA may hang when changing taskbar position/size, taskbar autohide and/or screen scaling.
- EQLock size is too big for SDL clients on non 100% windows scaling.
- ToggleTop is unreliable.
- For SDL clients when ScalA is maximized and the screen to the left and/is the Main Screen are/is in a bigger windows scaling mode it glitches when moving the cursor to the left border.
- Active Overview may cause cursor box to shake on non 100% Windows Scaling.
- On SDL clients EQLock doesn't work if you left-drag from inside client and release on EQ.
- There are still a bunch shenanigans on non 100% windows scaling.
- On SDL clients with spell icons enabled EQLock doesn't block right clicks.

There is an NVIDIA driver bug that makes zoom only go to max 2050 wide and tall and fills the rest with stripes.
-# Using restart tool found in CRU will fix until next pc restart/reboot. but it has habit of hanging some apps/games. ScalA does not have to be running while applying this.


**WishList**
- [x] Option to always start on Overview instead of autoselecting if there is only 1 alt. (implemented)
- [x] Show Idled alt names on caption. (implemented)
- [-] Autoselect Active Astonia Client. (not implementing)
- [-] Option to only list Alts on the same desktop as ScalA. (no official Windows API)
- [-] Overlay button with customizable QuickCommands. (not implementing - abuse prone)

-# Note: Items on wishlist may not be implemented at all. Feel free to post below with additional features you want added.
