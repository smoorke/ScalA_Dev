**Known Issues/Bugs**
- QuickLaunch may fail to close when clicking outside of QL after clicking an item with ctrl held.
- Having 2 instances of ScalA on differently scaled monitors attached to same alt is wonky.
  Having 2 instances of ScalA attached to same alt partially overlap leads to undesired results.
-# Please use white-/blacklisting when using multiple profiles.
- Overview button layout sometimes messes up when sorting lists are huge and/or closing a lot of Alts at once.
- ScalA may hang when changing taskbar position/size, taskbar autohide and/or screen scaling.
- EQLock size is too big for SDL clients on non 100% windows scaling.
- ToggleTop is unreliable.
- For SDL clients when ScalA is maximized and the screen to the left and/is the Main Screen are/is in a bigger windows scaling mode it glitches when moving the cursor to the left border.
- Active Overview may cause cursor box to shake on non 100% Windows Scaling.
- On SDL clients EQLock doesn't work if you left-drag from inside client and release on EQ.
- There are still a bunch shenanigans on non 100% windows scaling.
- On SDL clients with spell icons enabled EQLock doesn't block right clicks.

There is an NVIDIA driver bug that makes zoom only go to max 2050 wide and tall and fills the rest with stripes.
-# Using restart tool found in CRU will fix until next pc restart/reboot. but it has habit of hanging some apps/games. ScalA does not have to be running while applying this.


**WhishList**
- Option to always start on Overview instead of autoselecting if there is only 1 alt.
- Autoselect Active Astonia Client.
- Show Idled alt names on caption. eg `Bool (Someone)` or `Someone (Bool)` instead of just `Someone`. This for Overview as well as selected alts. 
- Option to only list Alts on the same desktop as ScalA.
-# This is a no go w/o an official windows api to see what window is on which desktop.(unofficial hacks have too many edge cases for different windows build versions)

-# Note: Items on wishlist may not be implemented at all. Feel free to post below with additional features you want added.
