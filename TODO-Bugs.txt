**Known Issues/Bugs**
QuickLaunch may fail to close when clicking outside of QL after clicking an item with ctrl held.
-# The only fix i know for this yields too many false positives on VirusTotal. I don't want to get my github account locked again.
Scrolling the resolution combobox doesn't work right when the first item is selected.
-# This item is used for the custom resolution set by dragging the borders or when maximized.
Having 2 instances of ScalA on differently scaled monitors attached to same alt is wonky.
-# Don't know if i can fix this. Please use white-/blacklisting when using multiple profiles.
Overview button layout sometimes messes up when sorting lists are huge.
EQLock size is too big for SDL clients on non 100% windows scaling.
ToggleTop is unreliable.
When Maximized and QL is open a single click on caption unmaximizes ScalA, sets wrong size and causes cursor tracking to be wrong.
There is an NVIDIA driver bug that makes zoom only go to max 2050 wide and tall and fills the rest with stripes.
-# Using restart tool found in CRU will fix until next pc restart/reboot. but it has habit of hanging some apps/games.

**ToDo**
- always sort resolutions so combobox scroll fix works right
